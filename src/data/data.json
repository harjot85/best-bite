      "lineTwo": "Our family-owned business does not compromise in gourmet quality. The dough is prepared fresh daily with the finest flour. The mouth watering, homemade tomato sauce is inspired by Italian cooking with a blend of seasonings fine-tuned over the years by the Kang family.",
      "lineThree": "We use a pasteurized, rich 100% milk mozzarella cheese grated fresh daily that we generously load our pizzas with. We use crisp, fresh veggies that are hand-cut every morning. All of this results in an exhilarating culinary experience."

      "This pizza is yummy! Loaded with a good portion of toppings and cheese, veggies are fresh, crust is perfectly soft in the middle and crispy on the bottom, and best of all the pizza is not greasy! Plus it’s super affordable and not overpriced like other pizza places. Totally recommend! Can’t wait to try the other toppings :)",
      "This is the best pizza we've had in Chilliwack! There used to be a place called Your Choice in Mission, we've searched for 15 years for a replacement, and this is it. We recommend the Canadian Classic. Perfect!",
      "We have tried many different pizza places since moving here. Best Bite Pizza is by far the best tasting, value for money pizza place ever!  The pizza is piled high. My husband and I can barely get thru a small pizza. Their pizza is incredible...yum yum."
